<img src="/api-n/showcase/ai.jpeg" width="100%" />

Welcome to Yoda AI, your ultimate AI companion! Yoda is designed to be your go-to solution for a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and providing insights to offering assistance and entertainment. In this document, we'll introduce you to the exciting world of Yoda AI and guide you through getting started.



## Introduction

Yoda AI is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence designed to enhance your daily life. It combines natural language understanding, machine learning, and a vast knowledge base to assist you with a wide range of tasks. Whether you need answers to questions, want to engage in meaningful conversations, or simply seek entertainment, Yoda AI has you covered.

## Key Features

1. Conversational AI: Hold engaging conversations with Yoda AI, just like chatting with a friend.

2. Knowledge Base: Access a wealth of information, facts, and insights across various domains.

3. Personal Assistant: Set reminders, create to-do lists, and get weather updates.

4. Entertainment: Enjoy jokes, riddles, and even some wisdom from the wise Yoda himself.

5. Customization: Tailor Yoda AI to your preferences and needs.


## Tech Used

1. Node.js: Yoda AI's backend is powered by Node.js, a fast and scalable JavaScript runtime. Node.js enables seamless handling of requests and provides a foundation for building robust server-side applications.

2. Express.js: Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, is used for building the API endpoints that power Yoda AI's interactions. It simplifies routing, middleware integration, and request handling.

3. TypeScript: TypeScript is the language of choice for Yoda AI's codebase. It adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity.

4. AWS Lambda: Yoda AI takes advantage of AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service, to host and execute its backend functions. AWS Lambda ensures high availability and scalability without the need to manage infrastructure.

5. Serverless Framework: The Serverless Framework streamlines the deployment and management of serverless applications, including AWS Lambda functions, making development more efficient.

6. Docker: Docker containers are used for local development and testing, ensuring consistency between development and production environments.

7. Langchain, LLMs & OpenAI: I started by using OpenAI to build the AI and I will include a branch called llm which has code for the same using Langchain and LLMs.



## Extras
I build a similar API to this in Golang. You can find it here in my github.
